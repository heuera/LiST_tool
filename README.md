# LiST Tool

## Aim
Create a tool that can quickly summarize data from LiST. This project is aimed at one specific output type for a project I am working on.

## How it works
Put each Excel file into the environment folder. The program then reads each file one-by-one and performs the manipulation. Each sheet is made into a seperate dataframe and cleaned to only include the relevant information. Resulting dataframes are put into an Excel file and saved into the folder. They are then ready to share with stakeholders at JHU.
